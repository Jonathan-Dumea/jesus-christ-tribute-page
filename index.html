        <h3 id="headline">The Life of Jesus Christ:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>BIRTH</strong> - Jesus is the Son of God but was born to a woman on earth.
            This faithful woman’s name was Mary. When Mary gave birth to Jesus,
            many signs and angels appeared so that faithful people could find Him and pay their respects.
            You may have seen this scene depicted through nativities at Christmastime.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>CHILDHOOD</strong> - Even as a young man Jesus was teaching the word of God.
            At 12 years old, Jesus was found “in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, 
            both hearing them, and asking them questions.
            And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers” (Luke 2:46-47).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>BAPTISM</strong> - When Jesus began His ministry at age 30,
            He walked many miles to the Jordan River to be baptized by His cousin, John the Baptist,
            who had the authority to perform baptism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MINISTRY AND MIRACLES</strong> - Jesus healed the sick, gave sight to the blind,
            and even brought the dead back to life. More importantly,
            He forgave people of their sins. Although His works were considered blasphemous behavior by the Jewish priests,
             Jesus continually reminded people that His works were aligned with God’s will so “that the Father may be glorified in the Son” (John 14:13).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CRUCIFIXION</strong> - Throughout His life, many were angry with Jesus because they didn’t understand Him.
             He taught unfamiliar things and showed compassion to sinners. He demonstrated incredible power,
              and some civic and church leaders felt threatened by His influence.
            Jesus was arrested and later crucified, or killed, which He allowed in order to fulfill God’s will.
             “I lay down my life,” the Lord said, “that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, 
             but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down,
             and I have power to take it again” (John 10:17-18). Even as Jesus was being killed by His own people,
             He cried out that God might have mercy on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>RESURRECTION</strong> - Three days after His death, Jesus rose from the tomb and the resurrected 
            Lord soon appeared to His friends and followers. He was the first to be resurrected,
            meaning His spirit was reunited with His perfected physical body after death. Because Jesus lived again,
            we will all be resurrected one day. 
          </li>
          
        </ul>
